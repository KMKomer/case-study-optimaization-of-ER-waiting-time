# case-study-optimaization-of-ER-waiting-time

The objective of this study is to optimise the patients' waiting times in 5 hospitals distributed through the U.S from a stimulated Kaggle dataset called E.R Wait time overview 

### The objectives of this study will be :

1- Identify the variables affecting patients' wait time and its distribution 

2- Estimate a descriptive formula that represents the interference of the various variables affecting the waiting time

3- train a Model to predict future waiting times and crisises that can affect patients' satisfaction 




### We will be performing 5 major steps to get :

1- Explotory data analysis 

2- Regression analysis 

3- Model building 

4- Evaluation
