# Here we reveal the insights of our data and Evaluate our model results 


Starting by the OLS results on different factors weights that effect total wait time.
The model was able to describe 95% of the total changes in the wait time for the numerical and catigrical data
provided in the OLS function. 
it was as follows: 

Total waiting time = the linear relationship between its logarithm and the following variables 
1. patients conts at a certain day
2. nurse to patient ratio
3. day of week
4. time of the day
5. season of the year
6. triage level
7. region
8. the hospital itself


The evaluation metrics were as follows:
 1. accuracy level =
 2. precision =
 3. F1 score
 4.
